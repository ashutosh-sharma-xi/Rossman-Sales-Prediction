Data provided by Rossmann gives various information about 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers were tasked with predicting their daily sales up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
